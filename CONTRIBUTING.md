Contributing
============

Community contributions are most welcome. Here are a couple of guidelines for
contributions.

* Install the dev. environment with `npm install`.
* Use GitHub pull requests.
* Reference existing open GitHub issues in commits where relevant.
* Styles, Tests: Always run `npm run check && npm test` to run all style and test
  checks. This is a test library -- it should pass its own tests. ;)

And, thanks!
