/**
 * Adapter: Mocha.
 *
 * This adapter assumes you have a single server and single client (e.g.,
 * one browser session) for all your tests. Thus, you need to manually set up
 * a known state in something like a `beforeEach`.
 *
 * Gives basic global setup / teardown.
 * - `before`
 * - `beforeEach`
 * - `afterEach`
 * - `after`
 *
 * That you can call in the first-run spec file (e.g., "base").
 *
 * If this doesn't exactly fit your scenario (e.g., want a new client for
 * certain tests), then review the code here and write your own setup/teardown!
